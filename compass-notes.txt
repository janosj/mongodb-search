With a search index created on the sample_mflix.embedded_movies collection,
search can be demonstrated inside of Compass using an Aggregation Pipeline.

Add a $search stage with the following spec:
{
    "search": {
      "query": "baseball",
      "path": "plot"
    }
}

Add a $project stage with the following spec:
{
  title:1, plot: 1
}

You can show an updated results list by simply changing the search term,
e.g. change "baseball" to "pirate" and note the different movies.
