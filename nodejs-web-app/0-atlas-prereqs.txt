This demo requires access to an Atlas cluster that has the sample data sets loaded.
Specifically, it uses the sample_mflix.embedded_movies collection.
The embedded_movies collection has a plot_embedding field, which can be used with Vector Search. 

Create the required search indexes as detailed in the README.
