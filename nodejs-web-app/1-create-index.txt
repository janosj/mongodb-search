Demo Prerequisite:
Create the following Atlas Search index on the sample_mflix.movies collection
(keeping 'default' as the Index Name):
{
  "mappings": {
    "dynamic": false,
    "fields": {
      "title": { "type": "string" },
      "fullplot": { "type": "string" },
      "genres": [ { "type": "string" }, { "type": "stringFacet" } ]
    }
  }
}

That index can be created using the JSON Editor within the Atlas UI.
Alternatively, you could use the API or the Atlas CLI. See here:
https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-search/create-index/

Note in the index definition that genres is declared as both "string" and "stringFacet".
"stringFacet" allows the application to identify the counts by genre for a given search, 
while "string" enables the app to subsequently narrow the search to any user-selected genres.
